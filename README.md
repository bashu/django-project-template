# django-skeleton

## Why?

To save others and my time I decided to make great django-skeleton considering
**best practices** used by django developers all over the world. If you find
something you'd like to be added pull requests or issues are highly appreciated.

## Usage

```bash
django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/bashu/django-skeleton/archive/master.zip --name=Vagrantfile myproject
```
